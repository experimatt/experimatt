# Experimatt

This is my personal website, currently live at [experimatt.com](https://experimatt.com).

See [BACKGROUND.MD](BACKGROUND.MD) for details about this and previous versions of my personal website.

# Deploy instructions
This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and the deployed version is just static html and CSS. The CSS is automatically re-generated via the tailwind-cli every time a commit is made.

## To deploy the app
Assuming you've set the upstream to `master`, all you need to do is:

```
git push
```

If you haven't set the upstream yet, you only need to do this once:
```
git push -u origin master
```
