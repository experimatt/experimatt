# Experimatt

This is my personal website, which is currently live at [experimatt.com](https://experimatt.com).

I tend to attempt a rewrite every year or so, but rarely finish. This version was written in April 2020, and I think it actually stuck because I kept it as simple as possible. It was written in straight html and css, along with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for style helpers.

## Previous attempts
* [old-experimatt.com](https://github.com/experimatt/old-experimatt.com): The most recent version, built using the [Stylish Portfolio](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/stylish-portfolio/) bootstrap template. Started & pushed live in Jun-16, active until Apr-20 when the new version went live. ([Live version](https://experimatt.github.io/old-experimatt.com/) hosted on Github Pages, for reference)
* [poc-experimatt-next](https://github.com/experimatt/poc-experimatt-next): An attempt using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). Started in Nov-19, never finished.
* [poc-experimatt-react](https://github.com/experimatt/poc-experimatt-react): An attempt using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/docs/). Started in Apr-18, never finished.

# Deploy instructions
